# layout-1

Here's a preview of it:
![layout-1 preview](/src/assets/layout-1-preview.png)

Just making pre-made create-react-app layouts/templates for myself to use so I can "git clone" and get up and going faster.

Feel free to use this if you want.

- It does not rely on any extra dependencies besides what comes preinstalled with create-react-app

- Note the background colors are kept the way they are to show each section and should be modified based on your needs.
